## Which extension balances features with browser performance?

Lighter extensions like Voila and MaxAI focus on core AI tasks without bloating your browser, while comprehensive platforms like Merlin and Monica pack dozens of features that may consume more resources. Test performance by opening DevTools and monitoring memory usage during typical tasks. Extensions with keyboard shortcuts like Merlin's Cmd+M or MaxAI's Alt+J minimize visible UI until needed, reducing constant resource drain. If speed matters most, start with focused tools like ChatGPT Writer for emails or Compose AI for autocomplete rather than all-in-one platforms. Pin only the extensions you use daily and disable others when not actively needed.

## Can I use multiple AI models without separate subscriptions?

Yes, several extensions bundle access to multiple models under one plan. Merlin provides GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 3.1 starting at $19 monthly, eliminating the need for separate ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, and Gemini subscriptions. Monica similarly offers GPT-5, Claude 4.1, Gemini 2.5, and DeepSeek V3.1 in one interface. Sider includes GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Grok 4 with group chat features to compare model responses simultaneously. This approach saves money and prevents context switching between platforms. Check usage limits carefully—some "unlimited" plans implement soft caps that throttle heavy users without clear documentation.

## Do these tools work across different browsers and devices?

Browser compatibility varies significantly. Chrome extensions like Merlin, Monica, and Sider also support Edge and other Chromium browsers, with Sider adding Safari compatibility. Voila and Monica extend beyond browsers with dedicated Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android apps for consistent cross-device experience. Perplexity Comet is a standalone browser rather than an extension, with mobile versions planned. Grammarly works across 500,000+ apps and websites with desktop applications for Word and Outlook. If you frequently switch devices, prioritize tools like Monica or Voila that sync across platforms. Extension-only tools require manual installation on each browser and device you use regularly.
